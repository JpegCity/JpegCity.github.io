# Jpegcity website

JPEGCITY is a real world utility project on Elrond Blockchain to promote travel in the cities as we know them today, using the handmade NFTs as building blocks. We aim to build a descentralized app on Elrond that gives rewards to the tourist that visits the city and to the owner of the city NFT.
